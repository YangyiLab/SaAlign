# SaAlign
## Libraries that Need to be Pre Installed
pyspark---must be compatible with the corresponding Python version to run
## Instruction
1. Downlosd ***SaAlign_package-1.0.tar.gz*** from websiteï¼š https://github.com/YangyiLab/SaAlign.
2. Unzip the downloaded file to a folder.
3. Enter the folder directory, open the terminal and enter the command :***sudo python setup.py***.
4. When writing Python scripts,Using Python statements:***from SaAlign.SaAlign import sa_align***, Using ***sa_ align*** for MSA operation.

## Parameter details:
sa_align(memory,application_name,filename,basepath,partition = 5,url = "local[*]")

### 1.memory
The memory allocated by each executor. The allocation of this parameter will affect the running success or not.
eg."2g","512m"
### 2.application_name
The name of the starting task.
eg."First_App"
### 3.filename
Name of fasta file for MSA operation
eg."virus.fa"
### 4.basepath
After extracting ***SaAlign_package-1.0.tar.gz*** ,the path of ***SaAlign.py*** 
### 5.partition
The number of all partitions specified when running the program,which can be specified by yourself
default = 5 
### 6.url
When running the program, the URL address of the spark cluster. The default address is localhost,that is, ___"local [*]"___, using all CPU cores for calculation.
eg."spark://192.132.232.1:7077"

## Known issues and planned updates
1. Known issues
There must be a line gap between each sequence in the fasta files.
The accuracy is good especially for the sequences which are quite different with each other but in this consequence the speed is relatively slow. 
2. TODO list
Offer more options to select the algorithm
